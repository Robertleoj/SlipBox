Image a website where you are presented with a prompt bar, and whatever porn you would describe, you could see. 

You would not need any pornstars, so that problem would go away. 

You could customize your own pornstar, and make them do anything you would want them to do. 

But the nasty thing is that you could generate imgery of very illegal things. Howe

* The realism might be what gets people off.
