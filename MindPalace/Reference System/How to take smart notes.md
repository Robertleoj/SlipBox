A book about how to take notes. 

Very simple principles

He claims that the books is for writers, students, and academics. 

Bottom-up instead of top-down

Need to use it right: it cannot become an archive of knowledge, or a graveyard of thoughts. 

Three categories of notes:
* Fleeting notes: should be trown away after processing
* permanent notes
* project notes: only applicable to a single project


He claims other types of note taking will always create sources of knowledge that is very inconvenient to access, and people never use/read their notes. Might be wrong, people do read their notes, but they might not use them to think, only remember. 

A claim:
You should act as if nothing counts other than writing: there is some good reasoning for this, but it only seems to apply to researchers and writers
