Cal Newport mentions the ioea of Keystone Habits. 

These are habits that do not produce a huge effect on the results you want to achieve, but keep your brain in the mindset that the results they aim towards are important to you. 

For example, you might do some kind of simple exercise often, in order to keep your brain informed that you value your health and fitness. 

Another one is meditation. It being very important in itself, it does serve nicely as a keystone habit for mental health and focus. It also reminds me that I should always value the moment. 

Let's use 50 push-ups a day as a keystone habit to remind myself that I care about my body, and value my fitness. 

Also, I should meditate every day. Even though I have not been good at that lately, I'm getting back on track. 

A third fantastic habit would be to do a leetcode problem every day. It shows that I value my skills and growth as a programmer.

I'll start by using my habit tracker again.
