How can you set your goals if you don't have an idea of who you want to be? Your goals will be pretty arbitrary. Even though most people's goals are pretty arbitrary. 

I really only know of one time where I sat down and tried to write about my carreer, and what I want out of it. It was very productive. I should do that again. 

I'm not sure when I will, but I really should.
