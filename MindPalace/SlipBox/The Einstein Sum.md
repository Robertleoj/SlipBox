Reference: [[Basic guide to einsum]]

The Einstein sum, or einsum as I will now refer to it is useful if you have two arrays $A$ and $B$ and want to 
* Multiply $A$ and $B$ in some way (element-wise)
* Sum the resulting arrays along some axes
* Transpose the resulting array in some way

Look at the linked article for details.
