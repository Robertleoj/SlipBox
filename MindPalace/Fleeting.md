Why implement yourself, instead of writing code
( implement attention, the github model, and a latent model)

Analyze the implementation of Linear attention[[DDPM github]]

How do continuous-time diffusion model work?

How do transformers work?

What are elucidated diffusion models?

What is cross-attention? seen in [[Reference System/Stable Diffusion]] (stable diffusion)

How do cold diffusion models work?

What if you would make a diffusion model that is like  recurrent model? So it keeps a hidden state and passes it forward on decreasing t.

Writing tasks down in a way that convinces your brain that they will be taken care of will remove them from your brain, and stop them from distracting you. 

Diffusion models: Why linear attention in the encoder and decoder of the Unet, but regular dot-product attention in the middle?

Diffusion models: If linear attention is just as good as dot-product attention but more efficient, why would anyone use regular dot-product attention? [[Efficient Attention Mechanism]]

Try to find novel uses for ides that you see. When you first saw autoencoders, you did not see many useful uses for them . But then they are a main character in stable diffusion. Keep your eyes open. 




## General

Your environment really does control the attitude you have - so clean your room and make it encourage the behavior you want to act out. 

Don't think before you put words on paper - do it while thinking - do it TO think

Any attempt to trick yourself into work with external rewards are short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. 

When you use rewards to trick yourself, you will not take long to skip the work you are rewarding yourself for, and go straight for the reward. This will leave you worse off than you started. 

Even if an idea is simple, it might need a completely different surrounding process/environment for it to properly work.

"fixed mindset": fearing feedback because it might damage your positive self-image

We tend to think we understand what we read, until we try to put it in our own words. 

The possible paths to take in learning and research grow exponentially in the radius of the sphere of discovery. Among the many implicaitons of this, it means that there is a tradeoff between breadth and depth of knowledge.
