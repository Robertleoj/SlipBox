There is a thing that I have done wrong many times. 

I have decided that I want to do something. And then I plan how to do it. And what I do, is work on that thing for an insane amount of time for a few days. At first, I work on it for so long because I want to work on it, and I'm excited. But then I want to continue working on that thing so much, while slowly losing interest in it. And then it starts to become a chore. 

An example of this is when I start to self-study AI or some kind of math. I just work on the thing for 10 hours a day, and then I just stop working on it at all. 

It might be that I lose the interest because I get desensitized to the fun of doing it, or that my brain notices that I probably shouldn't be doing it that much. 

Reasons aside, I should pace myself when I start to work on something. A much better Idea is to work on it for a few hours each time, and then using the rest of the day to work on some of my other interests, which might even be related.
