Squeeze-and-Excitation layers focus on channels relationships in vision networks. When the paper came out, it showed the at using the SE layers led to a significant improvement over other convolutional networks, at the cost of slightly increased complexity. 

We saw this layer often in the EfficientNet architecture, which performed very well in our Deep Learning computer vision project.
