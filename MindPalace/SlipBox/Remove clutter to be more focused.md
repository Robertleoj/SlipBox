To focus, you need to keep a clear head. To do this, you need to take care of things when they appear. Otherwise you will have an endless amount ot things floating around in your head, and won't be able to truly focus, or be in the moment. 

* Clean your room. 
* Clean up your correspondence. 
* Do the simple things you're procastinating. 

It is obviously apparent that these things keep floating in your head, you can feel them constantly interrupting your thoughts. Take care of them, and your head will be a lot less cluttered.
