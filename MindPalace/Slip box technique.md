This technique is outlined in  [[How to take smart notes]].  I am attempting to use it here in this note project. 

The steps for this system are:

1. Make short notes throughout your day. 
	*  Always keep a notebook with you to take these notes. 
	*  These should be short and simple, to remind you of what is in your head
	
2. Make reading/literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down the things that
	*  You don't want to forget
	*  You might use in your work or thinking
	Guidelines:
	*  Keep it short
	* Be extremely selective
	* Use your own words
	* Keep these notes with the reference system 
	
3. Make permanent notes. Do this ideally once a day.
	*  Go through the notes made in step one or two, and think about how they relate to what is relevant to you (your interests, thinking, or research). The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions. Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
	* Write exactly one note for each idea and write well: Use full sentences, disclose sources, make references, and try to be as precise, clear, and brief as possible. 
	* Trow away the fleeting notes. 
	* Put the literature notes from step two into the Reference System.
	
4. Add your new permanent notes into the SlipBox
	* Link to the new note in the NoteLinks section of some notes that you think the new node is directly related to. 
	* Add NoteLinks from this node to related notes
	* Make sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from the index, or by making a link to it on a note that is listed in the index. 
	
5. Develop your topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within this system. 
	* See what is here, see what is missing, and what questions arise. 
	* Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments
	* Take more notes, develop ideas further, and see where things take you
	* Follow your interest, and always take the path that promises the most insight.
	* Do not brainstorm for a topic! Look here to see where chains of notes have developed, and ideas have been built up to clusters. 
	* Don't cling on to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect, and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it.
6. When you want to use your notes
	* Collect the notes that were relevant
	* Look for things that are missing, irrelevant, or redundant. 
	* Don't wait until you have everything together, rather try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve the ideas and argument

Some principles:
* You donâ€™t tag notes in the context you found them. Instead, tag them in the context in which you want to discover them.
* Threshold to write down an idea should be low, but it is crucial to process them within a day or two
* Fleeting notes are reminders of thoughts, but permanent notes need to contain the actual idea or thought in written form, as written for somebody else. 
* The slip box is not a collection of notes. It is about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight. It could be considered a "save file" of your thoughts, as you can always pick up a thread of thought where you left off. Your thoughts can reach much much farther, as you can pick up the thread multiple times. Also, you can branch out much more. 
* It is the dynamic between the brain and the slip-box that make it so effective. 
* It's fine to make many literature notes from the same material
