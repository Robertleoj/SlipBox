Image generating diffusion models (or any other kind of image generators) will most likely have a huge application in image creation, and editing. 

Imagine a large-scale software like photoshop, but with a powerful suite of tools that are built with something akin to diffusion models. It would be the image editor's dream. 

The person could either start with a blank canvas, or an image they provide. 

Then they could use a combination of UI tools and english to tell the AI suite what they want done with the image. It would be beautiful dynamic between the human and the neural networks, creating pieces of art. 

Suppose an artist wanted to create a movie poster. They could start off with an empty canvas. Then they would prompt the AI to create a base image to work with. It might be an iterative process, or repeated prompting. They might start by prompting it for what they want, and then realize that it is not exactly what they were thinking. If it is somewhat close, the AI could modify the image in accordance to a command made in english. "No that's not quite right. I want the castle to be a little bit more melancholic.". If it is way off, they would say "No, scratch that. Give me something like this instead". 

Then when they get a reasonable base image, they would select various areas, and tell the AI what they want there, and what modifications they would like to perform. 

It would be beutiful. I'm pretty sure that people are doing this today, but as far as I know, there just does not exist a powerful, unified program to do this work in.
